# vimrc

This is my vim configuration.

## Setup

Perform the following steps.

1. Install clang (for clangd) and pylint
2. Run `./setup-vim.sh` or `./setup-nvim.sh`
3. Open vim/nvim
4. Type `:PlugInstall`
5. Close the resulting window with `:q` when it completes
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 once to ensure the theme and statusline plugins install completely

Updates can be installed via `:PlugUpdate`.
